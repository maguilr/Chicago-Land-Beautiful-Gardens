                <p class="long-copy"> Hello, we are Chicago Land Beautiful Gardens! We have been in this industry since 2001 and this all began with my father, and me the mini side-kick. Years have passed, we re-branded and now I hold the baton. We are pioneering a modern way of landscaping, using my education as a Landscape Architect to improve upon old practices, but also maintaining the principles that made us loved for many years &mdash; Thank you for visiting and we hope to work with you soon!</p>
